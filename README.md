# FVTT Sense Walls
A module for Foundry VTT that allows walls to block only certain senses, while other senses can "pierce" the wall.

Recommended for use with PF2e Rules Based Vision

## Supported Systems
* [Pathfinder 2e](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e)

## Features
Walls can be configured to only block up to a certain level of vision. For example, if the "Piercing Vision Level" is set to "Dakvision" then a character with darkvision or greater darkvision can see through the wall, but one with only low-light vision cannot.

This can be used to set up an area created by the [Darkness](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=59) spell, which blocks light from the other side.
